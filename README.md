I wanted to learn more about deconstructing arrays and objects, jest and tdd so I made this exercise file to help me and hopefully other people on their coding learning journey!

Covers:

- Deconstruction of Arrays and Objects
- Default Values

Install Jest using `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {

  }
}
```
